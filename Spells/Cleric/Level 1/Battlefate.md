This spell alters probability to favor one character or creature locked in battle. His opponent may stumble at an awkward time, a clumsy parry might catch the enemy’s weapon at just the right angle, or he happens to notice the foe moving in for a flank attack. The more powerful the priest, the more potent the aid; combat modifiers provided by battlefate equal +1 per three levels, so a 1st-level caster provides a +1 bonus, a 4th-level caster a +2 bonus, a 7th-level caster a +3, and so on to a maximum of +5 for a 13th-level priest. The exact form of the aid or assistance varies from round to round—roll a d6 to see which aspect of the subject’s combat abilities are affected in any given round. d6 Effect 1 Nothing happens 2 Defenses enhanced, apply bonus to subject AC 3 Luck enhanced, apply bonus to saving throws 4 Accuracy enhanced, apply bonus to attack rolls 5 Damage enhanced, apply bonus to damage rolls 6 Lucky opening! Subject gains one extra attack with either enhanced accuracy or damage (subject’s choice) If the character does not make a roll of the specified type in the round, he gains no benefit for the spell; for example, if the character gains the saving throw bonus but doesn’t have to make any saving throws during the round in question, battlefate doesn’t help him. Of course, in the following round, the spell may provide him with a different benefit. Note that on a roll of 1, battlefate does not help the character ththe priest intends to aid—such is the nature of chaos. The material component for this spell is an electrum coin tossed by the priest as he casts the spell.
