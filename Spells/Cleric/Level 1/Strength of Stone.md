This spell grants supernatural strength to the recipient by raising his Strength score by 1d4 points or to a minimum of 16, whichever is higher. Each 10% of exceptional Strength counts as 1 point, so a character with a Strength of 17 could be raised as high as an 18/30, but no higher. Both the priest and the recipient must be in contact with solid stone or earth when the spell is castâ€”standing on the ground will do nicely, but flying or swimming will not. The spell lasts for 3 rounds plus 1 round per caster level or until the subject loses contact with the earth. Obviously, this can happen in a number of ways, including being picked up or grappled by a larger creature, being knocked through the air by an impact or explosion, or even being magically moved in some fashion. The material components are a chip of granite and a hair from a giant.
