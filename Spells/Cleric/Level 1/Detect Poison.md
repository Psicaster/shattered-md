This spell enables the priest to determine if an object has been poisoned or is poisonous. One object, or one 5-foot cubic mass, can be checked per round. The priest has a 5% chance per level of determining the exact type of poison. The material component is a strip of specially blessed vellum, which turns black if poison is present.
