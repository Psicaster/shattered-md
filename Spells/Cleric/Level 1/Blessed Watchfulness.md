**Duration:** 4 hrs. + 1 hr./level

Sensory: None Critical: None By casting this spell, the priest confers exceptional powers of observation and alertness to one creature for the duration of the spell. While blessed watchfulness is in effect, the designated sentinel remains alert, awake and vigilant for the duration of the spell. In fact, it takes a roll of 1 to surprise someone under this effect. He resists sleep spells and similar magic as if he were 4 levels or Hit Dice higher than his actual level and gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against other spells or effects that could lower his guard or force him to abandon his watch, including charm, beguiling, fear, emotion, and similar mind-affecting spells. If the effect normally allows no saving throw, the watcher gains no special benefit.
