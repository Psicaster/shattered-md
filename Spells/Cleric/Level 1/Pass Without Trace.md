When this spell is cast, the recipient can move through any type of terrain--mud, snow, dust, etc.--and leave neither footprints nor scent. The area that is passed over radiates magic for 1d6 turns after the affected creature passes. Thus, tracking a person or other creature covered by this spell is impossible by normal means. Of course, intelligent tracking techniques, such as using a spiral search pattern, can result in the trackers picking up the trail at a point where the spell has worn off. The material component of this spell is a sprig of pine or evergreen, which must be burned and the ashes powdered and scattered when the spell is cast.
