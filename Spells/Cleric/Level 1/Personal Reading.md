This spell allows the priest to mathematically analyze personal information about one human or demihuman character and learn valuable facts about that character. To cast this spell, the priest must know the subject's real name (the name the subject was given as a child) or the date and place of the character's birth. The priest analyzes this information and is able to build a rough picture of the character's life history and personal specifics. The "historical" information discovered through this spell is generally vague. For example, the priest might learn that the subject was born in the woods and moved to the city only after hardship made his life untenable. Specific information is up to the DM. The DM might provide some or all of the following information. • The subject's character class or career The subject's approximate level (stated in terms such as "novice," "highly skilled," "moderately competent," etc.) • The subject's standing in the community ("highly respected," "mistrusted," "considered an enigma," etc.) • The subject's success or failure in his profession • The subject's prevailing character traits or mannerisms If the priest casts the spell based on an alias or incorrect birth information, the reading will be inaccurate. The DM should develop a history and personality at odds with the truth. This might allow the priest to determine whether the name of the subject is correct- -a reading giving information that conflicts with what the priest already knows should be a clue that the name is incorrect. The subject need not be present during the casting. The priest can cast the spell without ever having met the subject. The material component is a small book of numerological formulae and notes (different from the book used in telethaumaturgy). The book is not consumed in the casting. A DM may rule that this spell can be cast on humanoids or monstrous creatures. The information available will be similar (considering that words like "profession" will mean something different when applied to an ogre). This spell will categorically fail on creatures that have no concept of a personal name.
