This variant of the spell log of everburning changes one small fire no larger than a campfire into firelight. The flame ceases to produce smoke and becomes much cooler; within 1 turn of the spellâ€™s casting, the fire cools enough to be handled or touched barehanded without causing harm. The firelight is resistant to gusts of wind or poor burning conditions (pouring rain, lack of air, and so on), but complete immersion in water, vacuum, or magical darkness extinguishes the flame immediately. Firelight burns brighter and steadier than a normal flame, and a torch enchanted with this spell sheds light in a 30-foot radius instead of the normal 15-foot radius. The fuel source lasts throughout the duration of the spell. Unlike log of everburning, this spell is not at all useful for staying warm since firelight produces very little heat. Firelight inflicts 1d2 points of damage per caster level if cast on creatures of living or elemental fire, but has no other effect on these monsters. The material component is a mix of resins and incense, thrown into the flame to be affected.
