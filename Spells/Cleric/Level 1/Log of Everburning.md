This spell increases the amount of time that a wooden object will burn before being consumed. Wood that is enchanted in this manner burns brightly without being consumed for the duration of the spell. When the spell ends, the wooden object crumbles to ash. This spell does not cause the wood to catch fire; it must be ignited normally. While it burns, the wood gives off twice the normal amount of heat; thus, a single log can make a cozy fire. The affected wood radiates magic. The priest may enchant up to 1 cubic foot of wood per level of experience. The spell is effective on torches.
