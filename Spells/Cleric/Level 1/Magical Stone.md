**Range:** Touch

**AoE**: 3 pebbles

**Save**: None

**Casting Time :** 4

**Duration:** Special

By using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant up to three small pebbles, no larger than sling bullets. The magical stones can then be hurled or slung at an opponent. If hurled, they can be thrown up to 30 yards, and all three can be thrown in one round. The character using them must roll normally to hit, although the magic of the stones enables any character to be proficient with them. The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus. Each stone that hits inflicts 1d4 points of damage (2d4 points against undead). The magic in each stone lasts only for half an hour, or until used. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and three small pebbles, unworked by tools or magic of any type.
