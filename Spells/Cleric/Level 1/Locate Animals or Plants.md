The caster can find the direction and distance of any one type of animal or plant he desires. The caster, facing in a direction, thinks of the animal or plant, and then knows if any such animal or plant is within range. If so, the exact distance and approximate number present is learned. During each round of the spell's duration, the caster can face in only one direction (i.e., only a 20-foot-wide path can be known). The spell lasts one round per level of experience of the caster, while the length of the path is 100 yards plus 20 yards per level of experience. (At the DM's option, some casters may be able to locate only those animals [or plants] associated closely with their own mythos.) While the exact chance of locating a specific type of animal or plant depends on the details and circumstances of the locale, the general frequency of the subject can be used as a guideline: common = 50%, uncommon = 30%, rare = 15%, and very rare = 5%. Most herbs grow in temperate regions, while most spices grow in tropical regions. Most plants sought as spell components or for magical research are rare or very rare. The results of this spell are always determined by the DM. The material component is the caster's holy symbol.
