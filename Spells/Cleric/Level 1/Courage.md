One unit up to 200 individuals Saving Throw: None This spell imbues the target unit with a temporary burst of courage. To cast this spell, the priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the target unit. A courage spell enables a unit to automatically pass its first morale check following the casting of this spell. When circumstances arise that would necessitate a morale check, no die roll is made and the unit is assumed to have passed the check. After this occurs, the spell ends and the unit must make all future morale checks normally. If a unit under the influence of a courage spell is not forced to make any morale checks, the spell expires at the first sunset. When several different events simultaneously trigger morale checks, the BATTLESYSTEMâ„¢ rules apply penalties to a single morale check. If this occurs to a unit under the influence of a courage spell, the player commanding the unit selects one such event and its modifier is ignored. No more than one courage spell can affect a unit at one time. Once the spell has expired, a priest can cast the spell again on the same unit. The material component is a cube of cast iron.
