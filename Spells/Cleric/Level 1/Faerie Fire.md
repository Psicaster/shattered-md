This spell enables the caster to outline one or more objects or creatures with a pale glowing light. The number of subjects outlined depends upon the number of square feet the caster can affect. Sufficient footage enables several objects or creatures to be outlined by the faerie fire spell, but one must be fully outlined before the next is begun, and all must be within the area of effect. Outlined objects or creatures are visible at 80 yards in the dark and 40 yards if the viewer is near a bright light source. Outlined creatures are easier to strike; thus, opponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls in darkness (including moonlit nights) and a +1 bonus in twilight or better. Note that outlining can render otherwise invisible creatures visible. However, it cannot outline noncorporeal, ethereal, or gaseous creatures. Nor does the light come anywhere close to sunlight. Therefore, it has no special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures. The faerie fire can be blue,green, or violet according to the word of the caster at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the object or creature thus outlined. The material component is a small piece of foxfire.
