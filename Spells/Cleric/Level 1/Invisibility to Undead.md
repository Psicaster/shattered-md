**Save**: Special

**Casting Time :** 4

**Duration:** 6 rds.

This spell causes affected undead to lose track of and ignore the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Undead of 4 or fewer Hit Dice are automatically affected, but those with more Hit Dice receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. Note that a priest protected by this spell cannot turn affected undead. The spell ends immediately if the recipient makes any attack, although casting spells such as cure light wounds, augury, or chant does not end the ward. The material component is the priest's holy symbol.
