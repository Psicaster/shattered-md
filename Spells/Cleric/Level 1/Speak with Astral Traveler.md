When a priest casts the 7th-level astral spell, he leaves his physical body in suspended animation while his astral body travels. By touching the comatose body and casting speak with astral traveler, a priest can mentally communicate with the projected individual. Although communication is mental, it takes the same amount of time as a normal, verbal dialogue. The spell ends abruptly when its duration expires.
