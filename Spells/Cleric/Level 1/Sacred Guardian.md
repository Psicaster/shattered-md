By use of this spell, a priest becomes instantly aware when the recipient of the spell is in danger, regardless of the distance between the priest and the recipient. The recipient may be on a different plane of existence than the priest. When this spell is cast by a priest of at least 3rd level, he receives a mental image of the endangered person's situation. At no time, however, does the priest know the person's location through the use of this spell. The material component is a rose petal that has been kissed by the spell recipient.
