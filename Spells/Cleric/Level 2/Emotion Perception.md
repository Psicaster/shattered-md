This spell allows the caster to sense the emotional state and the level of determination of one or more military units. The priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the entire target unit. When this spell is cast, the priest instantly learns the current morale rating and morale status of the target unit. The DM describes morale using the appropriate term; for example, steady, elite, etc. The material component is the priest's holy symbol.
