This spell empowers the priest to comprehend and communicate with any warm- or cold-blooded normal or giant animal that is not mindless. The priest is able to ask questions of and receive answers from the creature, although friendliness and cooperation are by no means assured. Furthermore, terseness and evasiveness are likely in basically wary and cunning creatures (the more stupid ones will instead make inane comments). If the animal is friendly or of the same general alignment as the priest, it may do some favor or service for the priest (as determined by the DM). Note that this spell differs from the speak with monsters spell, for this spell allows conversation only with normal or giant nonfantastic creatures such as apes, bears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on.
