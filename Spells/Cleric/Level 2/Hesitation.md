Creatures affected by this spell hesitate before executing their intended actions. This causes them to modify their initiative rolls by +4. The initiative modifier occurs in the round following the round in which hesitation is cast. The spell affects 2-8 Hit Dice or levels of creatures, although only one creature of 4 or more Hit Dice can be affected regardless of the number rolled. All possible victims are allowed saving throws vs. spells; those failing their saving throws modify their initiative rolls by +4 for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level. The material component is a fragment of a turtle's shell.
