When this spell is cast, a faintly shimmering aura surrounds the recipient. The aura insulates the recipient from the effects of nonmagical heat and cold in a range of -20 F. to 140 F. Any time a traveler encounters temperatures in this range, he maintains a comfortable temperature of 70 F., regardless of prevailing weather conditions. Additionally, the spell acts as a shield against rain, snow, and hail, which are blocked by the aura. If a recipient encounters a temperature above or below the stated range, the temperature within the aura is altered by an equal number of degrees. For example, a recipient who encounters a temperature of 150 will actually experience a temperature of 80Â°F. All physical objects other than rain, snow, and hail can pass through the aura. The recipient can cast spells normally while the aura of comfort is in effect. The spell offers no protection against magically generated weather, such as that caused by weather summoning and ice storm. It does not protect against fire, nor does it shield against fire- or cold-based attacks.
