This spell stimulates the priest's mind to experience a flash of insight. In game terms, the DM reminds the priest's player of a fact or event that has been forgotten, overlooked, or discounted. Thus, the DM might remind the player about an important clue that the priest discovered but the player did not consider significant. If there are no forgotten facts, the DM may, at his discretion, tell the player of new information relevant to the condition at hand. The DM must be careful in adjudicating use of this spell. The reminder or information should always be relevant and useful but should not be unbalancing to the situation. The reminder can be cryptic, depending on the DM's campaign. The material component is a gold coin. This spell can be cast only once in any six hour period.
