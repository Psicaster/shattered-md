This spell is a sensitive version of the wizard spell ESP. In addition to detecting the surface thoughts of any creatures in range, the priest is able to probe deeper into the mind of a single creature. Mind read will always reveal the kind of creature being probed, although this identity may be couched in the creature's own language or in a (possibly distorted) body image. The spell has a 20% chance of revealing the character class of an individual. The details and the usefulness of the creature's thoughts will depend on the intelligence of the subject. While a priest could read the thoughts of an animal, he would probably receive only a confused jumble of emotions and instincts. Reading the mind of a highly intelligent wizard, however, would be much more illuminating; the priest might be amazed by the crystal clarity and deep insight of the wizard's mental processes. If mind read is used as part of an interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject receives a saving throw at a -2 penalty. If successful, the creature resists the spell's effects and the priest learns no information. If the saving throw is failed, the priest may learn additional information according to the DM's ruling.
