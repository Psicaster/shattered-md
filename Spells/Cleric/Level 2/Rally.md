This spell allows the subject unit to make an immediate rally check. It allows the check during the Magic Phase, rather than forcing the unit to wait for the Rally Phase in the BATTLESYSTEMâ„¢ rules. If the priest casting the spell is of 12th level or higher, the subject unit receives a +1 bonus to its rally check die roll. The priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the unit. The material component is a miniature duplicate of a pennant or standard that represents the cause for which the unit is fighting (such as a national flag or the blazon of the unit's liege lord). The pennant is consumed in the casting.
