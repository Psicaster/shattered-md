This spell causes a misty vapor to arise around the caster. It persists in this locale for four rounds per caster level and reduces the visibility ranges of all types of vision (including infravision) to 2d4 feet. The ground area affected by the spell is a square progression based on the caster's level: a 10-foot x 10-foot area at 1st level, a 20-foot x20-foot area at 2nd level, a 30-foot x 30-foot area at 3rd level, and so on. The height of the vapor is restricted to 10 feet, although the cloud will otherwise expand to fill confined spaces. A strong wind (such as from the 3rd-level wizard spell gust of wind) can cut the duration of an obscurement spell by 75%. This spell does not function under water.
