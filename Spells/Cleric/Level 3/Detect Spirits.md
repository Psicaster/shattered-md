This divination reveals the presence of disembodied or noncorporeal spirits of all types, including wraiths, ghosts, spectres, astrally-projecting creatures, characters or monsters employing magic jar or possession, and (of course) animal spirits and spirits of nature. Characters or monsters who are simply invisible, phased, or ethereal do not count as spirits, since they are physically present in the flesh despite their unusual status. The caster detects spirits in a path 10 feet wide and 60 feet long; any within the area of effect are revealed in their preferred form or appearance for all to see. Simply detecting a spirit doesnâ€™t give the caster any special ability to communicate with or attack the entity. The material component for this spell is a small pendant of copper wire worth at least 20 gp.
