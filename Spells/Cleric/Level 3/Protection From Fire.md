**Duration:** Special

The effect of a protection from fire spell differs according to whether the recipient of the magic is the caster or some other creature. In either case, the spell lasts no longer than one turn per caster level. If the spell is cast upon the caster, it confers complete invulnerability to: normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like); exposure to magical fires such as fiery dragon breath; spells such as burning hands, fireball, fire seeds, fire storm, flame strike, and meteor swarm; hell hound or pyrohydra breath, etc. The invulnerability lasts until the spell has absorbed 12 points of heat or fire damage per level of the caster, at which time the spell is negated. If the spell is cast upon another creature, it gives invulnerability to normal fire, gives a bonus of +4 to saving throw die rolls vs. fire attacks, and reduces damage sustained from magical fires by 50%. The caster's holy symbol is the material component.
