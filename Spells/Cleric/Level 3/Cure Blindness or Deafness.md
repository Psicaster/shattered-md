By touching the creature afflicted, the priest employing the spell can permanently cure some forms of blindness or deafness. This spell does not restore or repair visual or auditory organs damaged by injury or disease. Its reverse, cause blindness or deafness, requires a successful touch (successful attack roll) on the victim. If the victim rolls a successful saving throw, the effect is negated. If the saving throw is failed, a nondamaging magical blindness or deafness results.A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel, and suffers a -1 penalty to surprise rolls, a +1 penalty to its initiative rolls, and a 20% chance of spell failure for spells with verbal components. A blinded creature suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, a +4 penalty to its Armor Class, and a +2 penalty to its initiative rolls.
