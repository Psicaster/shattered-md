By casting this spell and touching another individual, a priest may fortify another's life force at the expense of a victim. This spell enables the priest to drain 1-8 hit points plus 1 hp per level of the caster from a living creature. The priest may immediately bestow the hit points on him- or herself, or transfer them to another individual within 1-4 rounds of the casting. The stolen hit points can increase those of the recipient beyond the normal maximum, and these extra hit points only last for up to one turn per the caster's level. Any damage suffered by the subject is first subtracted from these additional hit points. Though predominantly employed by evil priests at the expense of innocents, the spell may be used by those of noble intent, but only if all participants act of their own accord. However, if the victim (the donor of the life force) is unwilling, a saving throw indicates that the spell was partially resisted and only half the hit points were drained. Undead can neither benefit nor be harmed by life draining. It is possible, however, for an undead priest to drain hit points from a victim and bestow them on a living ally
