By means of this spell, the caster can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits his purposes. For example, he can make a stone weapon, a special trapdoor, or a crude idol. By the same token, it enables the spellcaster to shape a stone door, perhaps so as to escape imprisonment, providing the volume of stone involved is within the limits ofthe area of effect. While stone coffers can be thus formed, stone doors made, etc., the fineness of detail is not great. If the shaping has moving parts, there is a 30% chance they do not work. The material component of this spell is soft clay that must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object, and then touched to the stone when the spell is uttered.
