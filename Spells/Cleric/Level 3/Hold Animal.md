By means of this spell, the caster holds one to four animals rigid. Animals affected are normal or giant-sized mammals, birds, or reptiles, but not monsters such as centaurs, gorgons, harpies, naga, etc. Apes, bears, crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant beavers, and similar animals are subject to this spell. The hold lasts for two rounds per caster level. The caster decides how many animals can be affected, but the greater the number, the better chance each has to successfully save against the spell. Each animal gets a saving throw: If only one is the subject of the spell, it has a penalty of -4 on its roll; if two are subject, each receives a penalty of -2 on its roll; if three are subject, each receives apenalty of -1 on its roll; and if four are subject, each gets an unmodified saving throw. A maximum body weight of 400 pounds (100 pounds for nonmammals) per animal per caster level can be affected--for example, an 8th-level caster can affect up to four 3,200- pound mammals or a like number of 800-pound nonmammals, such as birds or reptiles.
