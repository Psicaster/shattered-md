By means of this spell, the caster empowers one or more creatures to withstand nonmagical fires of temperatures up to 2,000 F. (enabling them to walk upon molten lava). It also confers a +2 bonus to saving throws against magical fire and reduces damage from such fires by one-half, even if the saving throw is failed. For every experience level above the minimum required to cast the spell (5th), the priest can affect an additional creature. This spell is not cumulative with resist fire spells or similar protections. The material components of the spell are the priest's holy symbol and at least 500 gp of powdered ruby per affected creature.
