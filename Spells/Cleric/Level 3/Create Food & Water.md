When this spell is cast, the priest causes food and water to appear. The food thus created is highly nourishing if rather bland; each cubic foot of the material sustains three human-sized creatures or one horse-sized creature for a full day. The food decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be restored for another 24 hours by casting a purify food and water spell upon it. The water created by this spell is the same as that created by the 1st-level priest spell create water. For each experience level the priest has attained, 1 cubic foot of food or water is created by the spell. For example, a 2nd-level priest could create 1 cubic foot of food and 1 cubic foot of water.
