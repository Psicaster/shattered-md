A thief entering an area enchanted with thief's lament suffers a great reduction in his thieving skills. The thief is allowed a saving throw to resist the effects of the spell; failure indicates that he suffers the full effects of the lament. All attempts to pick pockets, open locks, find/remove traps, move silently, detect noise, climb walls, and hide in shadows are reduced by 25% (although a skill cannot be reduced below 5%, presuming the character has at least a score of 5% in any skill). The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times five feet (a 10th- level caster could affect a cube whose sides equal 50 feet). The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a silver key.
