A starshine spell enables the caster to softly illuminate an area as if it were exposed to a clear night sky filled with stars. Regardless of the height of the open area in which the spell is cast, the area immediately beneath it is lit by starshine. Vision ranges are the same as those for a bright moonlit night--movement noted out to 100 yards; stationary creatures seen up to 50 yards; general identifications made at 30 yards; and recognition at 10 yards. The spell creates shadows and has no effect on infravision. The area of effect actually appears to be a night sky, but disbelief of the illusion merely enables the disbeliever to note that the "stars" are actually evoked lights. This spell does not function under water. The material components are several stalks from an amaryllis plant (especially Hypoxis) and several holly berries.
