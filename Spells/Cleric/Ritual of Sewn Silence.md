##### Ritual of Sewn Silence
A Threadwalker may perform a Ritual of Sewn Silence to seal not only themselves, but others, to secrecy. This ritual is so powerful that [[The Weaver]] herself cannot pull the secrets from the participants. The secret shared among the participants is known only to them. To speak of it to anyone outside the Ritual is impossible. This ritual is not taken lightly by the Threadwalkers, and is rarely used except in matters they deem **very** important.
