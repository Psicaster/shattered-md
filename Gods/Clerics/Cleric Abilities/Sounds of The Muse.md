[[Musewalker|Musewalkers]] do not get [[Turn Undead]]. Instead, they channel the power of [[The Fool]] to inspire those around them. The inspiration of the Musewalker grants a +1 competency bonus to proficiency checks, ability checks and saves for all of the Musewalker's allies within 20ft. The channeling happens in the form of a tune, whether a sea shanty, humming a soft tune or tapping a rythm against their leg. The Musewalker must also incorporate their bells into whatever form their channeling takes. The bonus rises to +2 t level 6,+3 at level 11 and + 4 at level 16.
