## Threadwalker
  Though anyone can -- and often do -- pray to [[The Weaver]]. People often ask her to grant them wisdom in exchange for small secrets like who a schoolgirl has a crush on, or who keeps knocking over the neighborhood mailbox. But the truly devout often give up much more for their service to The Weaver. [[Threadwalker|Threadwalkers]] , as they are called, will often trade secrets for services from the church. Services include, but are not limited to protection, sanctuary, divination, absolvment of sins, and use of any skills the cleric may possess. The most devout will often give up a piece of themselves, such as one of their senses, for the secrets of the cosmos. Threadwalkers also often become explorers, searching for ancient knowledge that they may use for themselves, or trade to their patron for secrets of the cosmos. Sometimes these secrets drive the followers mad, for some things no mortal should see...

### Holy Symbol
Many, if not most, believe that the  [[The Weaver|Weaver's Cloth]] is the holy symbolf of the Threadwalkers, and publicly it is. However, each Threadwalker bears a holy symbol of his own. These are unique to each priest, and most who see them assume that they are mere trinkets the Threadwalker carries. Trinkets in the hands of a Threadwalker are not uncommon, as they collect many things from all over in order to glean their secrets. However, the holy symbol of the Threadwalker is an object that the threadwalker carries in secret. They do not reveal this item publicly, though their trusted companions may learn of it. They also must be sworn to secrecy through the *Ritual of Silence*, described in the **Class Features** section below. These objects are often woven into the fabric by [[The Weaver]] herself and put in the path of the Threadwalker as an object of desire. Threadwalkers are often obsessed with their holy symbols to the point that they will seek out the object unerringly when it is removed from them. The Threadwalker always knows the direction of their holy symbol, and can detect its presence from any distance as long as it is on the same plane as the Threadwalker.

### Class Features
Threadwalkers gain the following abilities:
- [[Threadbare Channeling]]: Threadwalkers can channel the power of [[The Weaver]] to Turn or Rebuke undead
- Threadwalkers can perform a  [[Ritual of Sewn Silence]] to bind others to secrecy in matters they deem important. (See spell description)
- [[Woven Secrets]]: At Third level, the Threadwalker begins to unlock the secrets of the Arcane, and can begin memorizing and casting Wizard spells as a wizard three levels lower than their current wizard level (Minimum 1)
- [[Loom of Secrets]]: At 7th level the Threadwalker can cast [[Zone of Truth]], [[Detect Lie]] and [[Detect Magic]] each 2/day. These abilities are used in the Threadwalker's line of duty to uncover secrets.
- [[Threadwalker's Sacrifice]]: If the Threadwalker wishes to progress to Level 9, they must give up something important to them. Some give up their voice or vision, others their sanity, some even give all their secrets.
	- In exchange for this price, the Threadwalker is granted a bonus rank in Spellcrafting, Gemcutting, Ancient History, Ancient Languages and Astronomy. 
	- The Threadwalker is also granted 25% resistance to Psionic attacks. This roll is made before any saves. If successful, the Threadwalker is also able to discern the location and nature of the attacker.
- [[The Weaver's Will]]: At 12th level, the Threadwalker is granted powers based on what they have given up to [[The Weaver]]. For example, if the Threadwalker gave up his sight, he may be granted a permenent boon of [[True Seeing]]. This is something the DM and the player must discuss, as the nature of the boon is often personal to the character.
