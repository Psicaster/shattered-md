# Soulsoother

Followers of [[The Traveler]] are referred to asSoulsoothers. They often are tasked with taking care of the dead. Most Soulsoother initiates spend a majority of their time in the mausoleums, wrapping the dead, and preparing them for the soul's final journey. They place small stones, known as [[Soul Stone|Soul Stones]], in the mouth of the dead. When the light of the soul stone fades, the Soulsoother removes the stone, and takes the body for disposal. At this point the body is considered little more than dead flesh, as the soul has completed its journey. Soulsoothers then take the body and dispose of it, often times burning it.

Soulsoothers are the only clerics that gain major access to the Necromancy sphere of divine magic, and therefore gatekeep resurrection spells. They do not often like to perform these spells for several reasons. First, they're exhausting, and age the caster three years. But second, and most importantly, casting resurrection disrupts the cycle of a soul's journey. Though, in some cases, when The Traveler feels resurrection is part of that soul's journey, he may grant the power to resurrect.

#### Holy Symbol

Though not a a holy symbol in the traditional sense, all Soulsoothers carry a set of fine bells. These bells are used to call the will of The Traveler to the priest, often with effects to the dead. Each bell is precious, finely crafted from pure silver. They produce haunting tones that resonate deep into the bones of all who hear them. If properly trained, high level Soulsoothers may even use the bells to control the undead.

#### Class Features

Soulsoothers gain the following benefits:

-   Soulsoothers do not turn undead in the traditional sense. The bells they carry as holy symbols have various effects on the dead.
	-   [[Chime of Ranna]] Any Soulsoother may turn undead using the first bell.
	-   [[Intonement of Kibeth]] At 4th level, Soulsoothers may command up to their cleric level in HD of undead using the second bell. These commands must be simple, similar to the command spell, unless the undead is intelligent. Intelligent undead may make a save vs spell to resist.
	-   [[Voice of Kyraneth]] At 7th level, Soulsoothers may fear the undead using the third bell.
	-   [[Dominion of Astarael]] At 12th level, Soulsoothers may dominate the undead to their will using the fourth bell.
	* [[Harmonious Tones]] At 15th level, Soulsoothers may user two of these bells in conjunction to produce combined effects.
	*  [[Speech of the Triad]] At 18ths level, the Soulsoother has mastered the use of three simultaneous bells.

-   [[Obscured Path]] At 3rd level, Soulsoothers gain the ability to cast [[Darkness]] 1/day.
-  [[Cloak of Night]] At 7th level, Soulsoothers are always under the effects of Invisibility to Undead. This cannot be seen through by most undead, though some exceptions may occur. This ability can also be seen through with True Seeing, or similar means.
-  [[Tongue of The Traveler]] At 12th level, Soulsoothers gain the ability to speak with dead at will.
