### God of Truth and Justice

The blind god of Truth and Justice. He sits at the end of the soul's journey across the Astral Plane, and judges its crimes. If the soul fails its trial, The Weaver knits it back into the fabric, and it is reincarnated. If they succeed, the soul is allowed to continue to the end. The Blind is considered the mightiest of the gods, and can be wrathful if tested.

#### Holy Symbol

The holy symbol of The Blind is a small golden scale. One side holds a heart that weighs the soul of the cleric, and the other side a feather. If the cleric's soul is pure, and he seeks the truth, the scale will always stand perfectly balanced.

#### Followers

Followers of The Blind, known as Truthseekers tend to be strong willed, and have a passion for the truth. They are iron willed, and as such must have a higher wisdom than any other clerics of the pantheon (Wisdom 15). Their duties bring them all over the known world as arbitrators, mediators and judges. Impartiality in the course of duty is key to being a Truthseeker. They must, and do, put aside all their personal knowledge and feelings. Truthseekers enter a state of divine channeling when they are making judgments that removes emotions and all memories of anything but the facts that were presented to them.

#### The Trial State

Truthseekers don't talk much about The Trial State, but some things are known to the public. The state does seem to take a lot out of the priest, both physically and mentally. Judgments made while in The Trial State are absolute, and are considered to be made on behalf of The Blind.

#### Crimes After Death

The crimes that are weighed when a soul reaches the end of its journey are not the crimes of man. The Blind does not judge whether or not you stole the bread, he judges why you stole the bread. If you stole the bread because you and your family were starving, and you had no other choice, it's likely The Blind will consider that a noble action. But if you were to have stolen the bread for greed -- to avoid paying for it, or perhaps you just could -- The blind will likely consider it an injust action.

#### Appearances

The Blind is often depicted as a tall, broad shouldered man roughly in his 40's. He wears a brestplate and pauldrons with a golden hue, and wields a similarly colored longsword in his right hand. In his left, is the symbol of The Blind, a golden scale used to weigh the soul against its crimes.
