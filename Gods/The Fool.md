# The Fool

### God Of Mirth and Art

The Fool is a seemingly carefree entity that gives its gifts to all those who believe in it, regardless of stature or status. They travel the world inspiring all those who persue their Art, and attempt to bring mirth and joy wherever they go. They appear in small ways; the laughter of children, the purr of a kitten or perhaps even just the smell of the ocean air. The Fool has no one form, or one means of being. They are the most versatile of the gods, and also the most chaotic.

Inspiration can sometimes come at a cost. The greatest paintings may never be appreciated until the creator has passed. The most inspired plans, no matter how flawlessly they are pulled off, can never account for every variable. The Fool can be tricky, and even (or perhaps especially) clerics  of The Fool must be careful for what they ask and how.

#### Art
Art is often misunderstood, as "Art" can sometimes refer to elaborate thefts or warfare as much as it can to dance or painting. As long as one holds a desire to improve their "Art" until the day they meet [[The Traveler]], they will find the inspiration of The Fool.

#### Followers
The most devout priests of The Fool are often referred to as "[[Musewalker|Musewalkers]]" or "[[Musewalker|Mirthbringers]]". They often wear bright colors and elaborate costumes, though there is no dresscode for the followers of The Fool. They love all who pray to them. [[Musewalker]] are often friendly, charasmatic folk with lofty goals, whether it be world domination, or writing the most beautiful poem the world has ever known. Truly the possibilities are endless.

#### Common means of worship
Prayers often take the form of sacrificing small pieces that represent their 'art', be it a sheet of music, a small statue, a baked good, a written out speech, or even a token of battle. Also, the truly devout, regardless of their personal alignment, often make small monetary sacrifices as thanks for the money they receive in life for their work.

#### Appearance
The Fool appears however the worshiper wishes to express in their works. A creature that enjoys all of man's expression of the self, wandering from place to place touching all those who are willing to embrace The Fool's inspiration.
