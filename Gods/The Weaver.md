## Goddess of Knowledge and Secrets
The Weaver is believed to have weaved the fabric of the Astral Sea. She wove together the stars, and  the space between them. She is also considered the mother of the gods, having spun them together from the very weave of the Astral Sea. She is a keeper of secrets, and has woven many of them into the universe to keep them hidden. She is also said to be the keeper of all magic, and has been known to make trades with her devout followers, often taking something from them in return for powerful secrets of magic, such as their voice, or sight.

### Holy Symbol
#### Weaver's Cloth
Weaver's Cloth is a small raw silk cloth, about 3in by 3in that has been blessed by the Threadwalkers. It's purpose is to be used in prayer to The Weaver. One would whisper their secret into the cloth, and fold it over twice, to create a folded square. The person then asks The Weaver for their blessing. This is often done alone, though people have been known to make prayers to The Weaver in public as well.

### Followers
Though anyone can -- and often do -- pray to The Weaver. People often ask her to grant them wisdom in exchange for small secrets like who a schoolgirl has a crush on, or who keeps knocking over the neighborhood mailbox. But the truly devout often give up much more for their service to The Weaver. [[Threadwalker|Threadwalkers]] , as they are called, will often trade secrets for services from the church. Services include, but are not limited to protection, sanctuary, divination, absolvment of sins, and use of any skills the cleric may possess. The most devout will often give up a piece of themselves, such as one of their senses, for the secrets of the cosmos. Threadwalkers also often become explorers, searching for ancient knowledge that they may use for themselves, or trade to their patron for secrets of the cosmos. Sometimes these secrets drive the followers mad, for some things no mortal should see...

#### Appearances
The Weaver is often portrayed as an old hunched over woman wearing a simple gray robe. Her thin frail fingers work a loom, weaving the very fabric of the cosmos. She very rarely makes appearances to anyone but her clerics, though her blessings are felt by some who pray to her. Her presence manifests in subtle ways, a cat knocking over a cart to keep you safe from a passing carriage, or a conveniently overheard conversation that helps you keep your job. The Weaver is the most mysterious of the gods, and existence of the Threadwalkers doesn't help.

#### The Cosmic Fabric
The Cosmic Fabric is the place beyond the sky. It's the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the strange planets in between. Though no one from the Shattered World has ever been to the Astral Sea, many have tried; most ending in death. No one truly knows or understands whats' beyond the sky. Several astronomers have studied the sky since The Shattering, but a precious few truly understand what they're seeing.
