# The Traveler

### God of Death

The Traveler. A powerful being who travels the Astral Plane. He is known to help souls travel across the Astral Plane to their trial with [[The Blind]]

. Though he's the god of death, he's often seen as a comfort to most, and places of worship can be found all over the known world. The Traveler is the only god that has access too the Necromancy sphere.

#### Followers
Followers of The Traveler, referred to as [[Soulsoother|Soulsoothers]], often take up the responsibility of tending to the dead, and performing burial rites and placing [[Soul Stone|Soul Stones]] in the mouths of the recently deceased. They care for bodies in the mosoleums, wrapping them and preserving them.

#### Death
One might assume the "God Of Death" to be a black hooded horror who comes for you when you die. Or some evil necromantic entity. But the truth is that death is not the true end. That's why the Soul Stones are used; to signal when the soul has finished it's journey. Souls can reach the end only after a trial with The Blind. If the soul is deemed innocent of all crimes, and the soul has come to terms with the end of its journey, it is either reincarnated, or allowed to continue to the end. There is no minimum or maximum real world time for this journey, as the same soul can exist separately in several incarnations. The Traveler's role in all of this is to lead the souls through the astral plane, so they don't get lost (and subsequently become 'lost souls').

#### Common means of worship

Often times people will use[[Traveler's Candle|green-flamed candle]] to pray to The Traveler. People will pray to him to aide the souls of loved ones, or to bring them items burned in the flame, to aide in their journey to the end. Some people will also go to a temple of The Traveler, and burn larger objects within the much larger green flames housed within. Standard prayer is not uncommon either, though your prayer will not have the conduit of the green flame to carry its message.

#### Appearance

The Traveler is often seen as a frail, but kindly old man. He wears nicely tailored clothes, and a long tattered traveler's cloak. He has long white hair, and sometimes a beard. When he travels with a soul, he is kind, humorous, and generally joyful. He will answer questions as he leads the souls along the roads of the astral plane, taking them from place to place along their journey. Those few living who have been lucky enough to communicate with him directly have said "He's friendly enough..." He will sometimes appear to followers who travel the Astral Plane to help them navigate to their destination.
