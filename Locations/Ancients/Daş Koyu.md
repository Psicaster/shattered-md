**Pronounced: Dash Ko-you**

An ancient harbor of the [[Dəniz xalqı]]. Large rusted steel beams stick from the shore like dozens of red boar tusks sticking from the black silty beach. Enough broken and rotted boards remained to tell those that found them this used to be a harbor. And its deep waters seemed perfect to host the incoming rush of large ships containing [[The Migration|the survors]]  of [[The Shattering Of The World|The Shattering]].

It has since become the township of [[Righold]] under the rule of the [[Archerian Empire]]. The rusted steel harbor has been partially restored. Here, the [[Archerian Empire]] hosts their navy, having turned the ancient ruins into a now fully functional naval yard they call [[Duskpoint Harbor]]. Righold itself of coruse has a private harbor known as [[The Blackmoss Piers]].
