After [[The Shattering Of The World]], there was a message that went out to all living beings. Understood by all. There was a place that was largely untouched by the disaster. This place became know at [[Worldhaven]]. 

Here, three [[The Nations of Worldhaven|nations]] formed. The mighty steel nation of [[Draknir Foundry]] with its impenetrable capital [[Kagwohr]]. The magical and prideful [[Hythiel Alliance]], who have isolated their capital [[Mytalthyr]] to an island off the southwest coast of [[Worldhaven]], And the proud and traditional [[Archerian Empire]], who have built their nations around the cratered city of [[Tinewall]].
