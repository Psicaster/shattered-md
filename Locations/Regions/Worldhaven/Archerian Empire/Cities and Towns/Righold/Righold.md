# Righold

****

Among the rusted ruins of the ancient [[Dəniz xalqı]] harbor, [[Daş Koyu]], is a wretched sea town under rule of the [[Archerian Empire]]. Though the [[Archerian Navy]] does host its ships here, the place has become known to be a safe haven for pirates and criminals. [[Archerian Navy|The Navy]] seems to look the other way once someone reaches the shores of [[Righold]]. No one's particularly sure why, but some suspect the long standing (read: Only) [[Geneva 'Shark Bait' Astley|mayor]] of [[Righold]] may have something to do with it.
