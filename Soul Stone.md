#### Soul Stones

Small round magical stones that are placed in the mouth of the dead by [[Soulsoother|Soulsoothers]]. They glow a soft green to indicate that the soul is still making its final journey with [[The Traveler]]. When the light fades, it means the soul has reached the end, and the body can be properly dealth with. Usually by cremation.

Some soul stones have been lit for several hundred years, while others can sometimes dim within a day. No one can be sure why some take longer than others, but the most commonly held belief is that the souls must come to terms with their lives through a series of trials with [[The Blind]]
